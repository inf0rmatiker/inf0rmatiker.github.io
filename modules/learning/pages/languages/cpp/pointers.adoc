Pointers are just integers that represent memory addresses.

=== Defining Pointers

A pointer is _just a memory address_ -- an integer, so it 
doesn't need a type. Giving a pointer a type
just states that the data at that address is the type
we specified.

Here we've defined a pointer with memory address `0`.
Note that `0` is not a valid memory address. It's
the same as `NULL`. 

[,cpp]
----
// These are all equivalent
void *ptr = 0;
void *ptr = NULL;
void *ptr = nullptr;
----

What if we want to create a useful pointer that points to
a valid memory address, like a variable in our program?

[,cpp]
----
int var = 16;

// &var is the memory address of var.
// int * is our way of telling what the data type is that
// ptr points to. Using void * would also be valid.
int *ptr = &var;
----

=== Using Pointers

We can use a pointer to manipulate the data stored at its 
address, by _dereferencing_ the pointer using a `*`.

Using the snippet above as an example:

[,cpp]
----
int var = 16;
int *ptr = &var;

// Writing from a pointer:
// Go to the address stored in ptr and set the value there to 13
*ptr = 13;

// Reading from a pointer:
// Retrieve the value at the address stored in ptr, save to myvar2
int myvar2 = *ptr;
----

We can allocate space on the heap, which returns a pointer to
the beginning address, set all the values to 0, then clean up.

[,cpp]
----
// Allocate 8 chars in heap, and return a pointer to first one
char *buffer = new char[8];

// Sweep 8 bytes starting at buffer and set each value to 0.
memset(buffer, 0, 8);

// Clean up allocated memory.
delete[] buffer;
----


=== Double, Triple Pointers

Pointers themselves are stored in memory, and have a 
memory address of their own. You can create a pointer
whose memory address references that of another pointer. 
These are essentially just pointers to pointers.

An example of this:

[,cpp]
----
int var = 16;

// Just like before, ptr1 is an int pointer
int *ptr1 = &var;

// Store address of ptr1 in ptr2
// ptr2 is a pointer to an int pointer, hence int **
int **ptr2 = &ptr1;

== Smart Pointers

Smart pointers are a way to automate the process of allocating and freeing memory on the heap. 
They're just a wrapper around a raw pointer.

With raw pointers, we would need to do:

[,cpp]
----
// Allocate 8 chars in heap, and return a pointer to first one
char *buffer = new char[8];

// ... do something with buffer ...

// Clean up allocated memory.
delete[] buffer;
----

Different types of smart pointers:

* `std::unique_ptr`: When this pointer goes out of scope, it will be destroyed (`delete` will be called on it). These are scoped, so you can't copy a `unique_ptr`, because when one copy of it dies, that memory is freed so all other copies just reference freed memory.
* 

=== Using Smart Pointers

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/smart-pointers-cpp/#[GeeksForGeeks - Smart Pointers]

The first thing we'll have to do to get access to these smart pointers is to `#include <memory>`.

We'll be using the following class to demonstrate the
functionality of smart pointers:

[,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

// Class to show creation/destruction of smart pointer
class Entity {
    public:
    
        // Constructor
        Entity() {
            std::cout << "Created Entity!\n"; 
        }
    
        // Destructor
        ~Entity() {
            std::cout << "Destroyed Entity!\n";
        }
        
        void entityPrint() {
            std::cout << "print() invoked\n";
        }
};
----

--- 

`std::unique_ptr`

If we want to create a pointer that lives in a certain scope, we can do that like so:

[,cpp]
----
int main() {
    {
        std::unique_ptr<Entity> entity = std::make_unique<Entity>();
        
        entity->entityPrint();
    }
}
----

NOTE: You can only have *1* copy in existence for the life of a `std::unique_ptr`. Its life and death is within the scope that it was defined in. For example, you cannot do something like
`std::unique_ptr<Entity> e2 = entity`, this would not even compile.

---

`std::shared_ptr`

By using `shared_ptr`, more than one pointer can point 
to this one object at a time and itâ€™ll maintain a 
Reference Counter using the `use_count()` method
(GeeksForGeeks). 
Each time a shared pointer falls out of scope, 
the allocated object's reference counter is decremented.
Once the reference count reaches zero, the object is
deallocated and freed.

Example:

[,cpp]
----
int main() {

    std::shared_ptr<Entity> e2;
    {
        std::shared_ptr<Entity> e1 = std::make_shared<Entity>();
        std::cout << e1.use_count() << '\n';
        e2 = e1;
        e2->entityPrint();
        std::cout << e2.use_count() << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << e2.use_count() << '\n';
}
----

Example output:

[,console]
----
Entity constructed()
1
print() invoked
2
1
Entity destructed()
