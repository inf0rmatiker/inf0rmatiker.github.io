== VNC/GUI Install Guide

Once you've booted the live CD, you'll need to manually walk through the process of configuring your OSS Leap 15.3 distribution.
In this guide we're just using the node's iLo BMC HTML5 console to walk through the installation process.

Choose "Installation".

You should see it go through loading basic drivers, hardware detection, etc.

After this is done, it moves to initialize basic networking configuration.

Eventually, it will ask you what type of installation we want. We're going to be using a headless server setup,
so choose `Server`:

Next, it's will suggest a partitioning scheme based on what it sees already on the disks.

We want to choose our own partitions, though, so choose "Guided Setup". It will then ask you to select your hard disk.

Choose the `/dev/nvme0n1` drive and click "Next". It will then ask what partitions you want to create and what you want 
to do about existing partitions. We want to remove them; we're starting from a clean slate.

It should then ask you if you want to enable LVM, choose yes, and it will then ask you what filesystem type you want your
partitions to be. Here we chose EXT4, but it's up to you if you want that or BTRFS.

Lastly, it will show you a list of what it's going to do in order to set up your installation disk. Review this and click "Next".

Select your timezone.

Set up a local user if you want. Here we opted to just stick with the `root` user.

Configure a password for the `root` user.

Review the final installation settings, then launch the install.

Your install should take a few minutes.

Once the installation finishes, the system will reboot, and you'll be given a login screen.
