The binding configuration needs to be correct.

The idea is to minimize latency going from CPU to GPU. Typically you have NUMA domains, you specify the closest NUMA domain for each CPU. 
In our system you only have half the PCI lanes, so you have to make a mapping based on cores.

See the current mapping using the following:

[,bash]
----
nvidia-smi topo -m

Legend:

  X    = Self
  SYS  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the SMP interconnect between NUMA nodes (e.g., QPI/UPI)
  NODE = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the interconnect between PCIe Host Bridges within a NUMA node
  PHB  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as a PCIe Host Bridge (typically the CPU)
  PXB  = Connection traversing multiple PCIe bridges (without traversing the PCIe Host Bridge)
  PIX  = Connection traversing at most a single PCIe bridge
  NV#  = Connection traversing a bonded set of # NVLinks
