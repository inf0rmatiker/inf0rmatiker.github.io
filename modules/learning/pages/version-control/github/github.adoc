== Create a Branch

First, check out the branch you want to base your new branch off of. In this example, I'll use `main-1.3`:

Then, type in the name of the new branch you wish to create, and select "Create branch from <base branch>":

== Delete a Branch

This is for deleting a branch on the remote GitHub repository.

You can use the GitHub repository web UI to delete the remote branch by navigating to your repo page,
then selecting **14 branches** (in this example):

Then, click the Trash icon next to the branch you wish to delete:
