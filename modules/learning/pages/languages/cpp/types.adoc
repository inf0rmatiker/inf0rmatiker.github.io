= C++ Data Types

== Datatype Modifiers

As the name implies, datatype modifiers are used with built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold. Data type modifiers in C++ are:

* `signed`
* `unsigned`
* `short`
* `long`

== Const

`const` (constant) variables cannot be changed by your program during execution.

[,cpp]
----
const double quarter = 0.25;
// and now variable quarter can only be 0.25
----

Simply add the keyword `const` before the data type during declaration to make the variable not modifiable.

== Type Conversion

A type cast is basically a conversion from one type to another.

The notation `(type) value` means "convert value to type". So for example:

[,cpp]
----
double weight1;
int weight2;

weight1 = 154.49;
weight2 = (int) weight1;

// weight2 is now 154
----

NOTE: Going from a `double` to an `int` simply removes the decimal. There's no rounding involved.
