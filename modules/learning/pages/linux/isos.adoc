== Mounting an ISO

[,bash]
----
mkdir /mnt/test-iso
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /mnt/images/test.iso /mnt/test-iso
----

This is a read-only filesystem, you cannot write/change the contents of the ISO
directly. To do so, you'd need to copy the contents to a read-write directory,
then change those contents, and re-build the ISO from that.

== Creating an ISO

To get `mkisofs`: `dnf install xorriso`

Prepare a directory with the contents you want in your ISO. Here we'll be
packaging a DAOS ISO.

[,bash]
----
mkisofs -v -untranslated-filenames \
        -appid "DAOS 2.6.2" \
        -publisher HPE \
        -preparer HPE \
        -V DAOS-2.6.2 \
        -rational-rock -translation-table -o $HOME/DAOS-2.6.2-x86_64.iso .
