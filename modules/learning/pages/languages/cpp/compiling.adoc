= Compiling and Executing

:toc: auto

Given some basic program, `hello.cpp` below, how can we compile and execute our code?

[,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
  return 0;

}
----

To compile a simple `.cpp` file alone to `a.out`, you can run:

[,bash]
----
g++ hello.cpp
./a.out
----

Example:

[,console]
----
➜  simple1 g++ hello.cpp
➜  simple1 ls
a.out  hello.cpp
➜  simple1 ./a.out
Hello World
----

To compile our `.cpp` file to binary and give it a name:

[,bash]
----
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
----

A compiler translates the C++ program into machine language code which it stores on the disk as a file with the extension `.o` (e.g. `hello.o`). A linker then links the object code with standard library routines that the program may use and creates an executable image which is also saved on disk, usually as a file with the file name without any extension (e.g. `hello`).
