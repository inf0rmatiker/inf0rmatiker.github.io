## Description

In this video I give an overview of how to exhaust hot air generated by your PC outside a nearby window using dryer duct, active fans, and a template made from plywood.

Materials for the build:

* 2x AC Infinity 140mm fan, Amazon
* 6 inch flexible dryer duct, Home Depot
* 6 inch PVC riser pipe, Home Depot
* 4 inch dryer vent hood, Home Depot
* 1/2 inch MDF board
* 1/4 inch plywood, 30" wide
* 1/4 inch dowels
* 1x2 pine boards for fan brackets

You'll need a router to make the 6 inch holes, miter saw or table saw to cut the plywood/mdf, and pine brackets for the fans. You'll also need a pipe saw for the PVC pipe.
